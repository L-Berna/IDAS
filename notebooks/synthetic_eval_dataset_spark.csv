What should you do before using the air conditioning system if your vehicle has been parked in direct sunlight?,"4–10  HEATING & AIR CONDITIONING
OPERATING TIPS
• Before using the air conditioning sys-
tem, open the windows for a few min-
utes to permit hot air to escape if the
vehicle has been parked in direct sun-light.
• For maximum cooling, select the venti-
lation mode and the highest fan speed.
Make sure that the air conditioningcompressor is turned on. Then rotatethe temperature control knob to selectthe coolest temperature and select therecirculation mode.
• To defog the windows on rainy days
or in high humidity, turn on the airconditioning compressor.
• Turn on the air conditioning for a few
minutes at least once a week, even inthe winter or when the air conditioningsystem is not being used regularly. Thismaintains proper lubrication of the
compressor and seals, prolonging the
service life of the system.
• Driving in stop-and-go traffic may
reduce the effectiveness of the air
conditioning system.• To quickly defog or defrost the front
windshield, use the defrosting mode,
set the temperature to warm, and setthe fan at the highest speed.
• Defroster mode will operate with the air
conditioner on or off.
• Turn the air conditioner on to improve
the efficiency of the defroster.
• Do not use the heating/defogging mode
or the defrosting mode in extremelyhumid weather when the temperaturecontrol is set to cold.AIR OUTLETS
To open an outlet, press on its cover.Rotate the cover to direct airflow asdesired.

"According to the Chevrolet Spark manual, how often should you check your tire pressure, and what tool should you use for this check?","SERVICE AND VEHICLE CARE  7–25
See “VEHICLE SPECIFICATIONS” on
page 9-6 for proper tire inflation pressure.
Tire condition should be inspected before
driving and tire pressure should be
checked each time you fill your fuel tankor at least once a month using a tire pres-sure gauge.
Incorrect tire inflation pressures will:
• Increase tire wear.
• Impair vehicle handling and safe opera-
tion.
• Affect ride comfort.
• Reduce fuel economy.
If tire pressure is too low, tires can over-
heat and suffer internal damage, treadseparation, and even a blowout at high
speeds. Even if you later adjust the infla-
tion pressure of your tires, previous driv-ing with low pressure may have damagedthe tires.Caring for your tires and wheels
Driving over sharp objects can damage the
tires and wheels. If some objects are un-avoidable, drive over them slowly and ata right angle, if possible.
When parking, avoid making contact with
the curb.
Periodic tire inspection
• Visual damage.• Foreign objects
• Punctures.
• Cuts.
• Cracks.
• Bulges in the sidewalls.
Check the wheels for damage.
Tire defects including those above can
cause loss of control of your vehicle, re-
sulting in a possible collision.
If your tires or wheels are damaged or
show abnormal wear, consult yourCHEVROLET retailer.BUILT-IN TREAD WEAR INDICATOR
Regularly check the tread depth of yourtires using the tire’s built-in tread wear in-
dicators. Markings on the sidewalls indi-
cate the locations of the tread wear indi-cators. CAUTION
Use of tires of a size other than origi-
nally fitted to your vehicle may causeinterference between tires and vehiclecomponents, and may result in tire and
vehicle damage.
 CAUTION
• Do not drive on worn or damaged tires.
Such tires can cause you to lose con-
trol of the vehicle and a collision, re-sulting in injuries or damage to yourvehicle or other property.","According to the Chevrolet Spark manual, you should check your tire pressure each time you fill your fuel tank or at least once a month. The tool recommended for this check is a tire pressure gauge."

What should you do if your brakes temporarily lose their stopping power due to overheating while driving down a steep hill?,"5–12  DRIVING YOUR VEHICLE
 WARNING
After driving thr ough deep water,
washing the vehicle, or using the
brakes excessively when going down
a steep hill, the brakes can temporarilylose their stopping power. This may bedue to wet brake components or over-
heating.
If your brakes temporarily lose their
stopping power because of overheating:
•Shift to a lower gear when going
down hills. Do not continuously ap-
ply the brakes.
If your brakes temporarily lose their
power because of wet brake compo-
nents, the following procedure will help
restore their normal performance:
1. Check behind you for other ve-
hicles.
2. Keep a safe forward speed with
plenty of space to your rear and
sides.
3. Gently apply the brakes until nor-
mal performance is restored.PARKING BRAKE
The parking brake acts on the rear wheels.
The parking brake lever is located between
the front seats.
To set the parking brake, stop the vehicle,
press the brake pedal and pull the lever up
firmly.
To release the parking brake, press the
brake pedal and;
1. Pull the lever up slightly.
2. Push the button on the tip of the lever.
3. Lower the lever while holding the but-
ton in. CAUTION
•Do not drive with the parking brake
on.
This can cause your rear brakes to
overheat or wear out prematurely. You
may have to replace them, and you
could damage other parts of your ve-hicle. WARNING
If the parking brake is not set prop-
erly, the vehicle may move suddenly.See your CHEVROLET retailer if anadjustment is required.
 CAUTION
•Do not park or operate your vehicle
over combustible materials.
They could touch hot exhaust parts un-
der your vehicle and ignite.
